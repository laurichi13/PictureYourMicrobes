# PictureYourMicrobes

PictureYourMicrobes is a public engagement project, with the main objective of **empowering citizens with risk factors for developing NCDs, particularly people living with overweight or obesity, by raising awareness about the importance of taking care of the bacterial communities (microbiome) living on our bodies.**  
To achieve this objective we propose the following specific actions: 
1. Develop a co-creation project of citizen science and public engagement through the use of focus-groups and photovoice activities.
2. Disseminate results to the general public through photovoice exhibitions and social media, and 
3. Assess the impact in the community.
